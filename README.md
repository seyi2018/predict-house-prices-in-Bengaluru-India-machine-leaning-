Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices in Bengaluru (Bangalore), India, based on various features such as location, size, area type, and other property characteristics. The model utilizes regression techniques to estimate property values, which can be valuable for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Bengaluru House Price" dataset. It contains information about residential properties in Bengaluru and includes features like:

* `area_type`: Type of area (e.g., Super built-up Area, Built-up Area).
   
* `availability`: When the property is available.
   
* `location`: Location of the property in Bengaluru.
   
* `size`: Size of the property (e.g., number of BHK - Bedroom Hall Kitchen).
   
* `society`:  Name of the society.
   
* `total_sqft`: Total square foot area of the property.
   
* `bath`: Number of bathrooms.
   
* `balcony`: Number of balconies.
   
* `price`: Price of the property (the target variable).

The dataset is in CSV format (`bengaluru_house_prices.csv`).

## Analysis Steps

The following steps were performed in this analysis:

1.  **Importing Libraries:**
    * [cite_start] Imported necessary Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (for model and metrics), and scipy (for stats)[cite: 5].

2.  **Loading the Dataset:**
    * [cite_start] Loaded the dataset from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame[cite: 5].
    * [cite_start] Displayed the first few rows of the DataFrame to understand its structure and content using `df.head()`[cite: 5].
    * [cite_start] Displayed the last few rows of the DataFrame using `df.tail()` to check for any inconsistencies or patterns at the end of the dataset[cite: 5].

3.  **Data Exploration:**
    * (The notebook includes further steps of data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building, but a detailed breakdown requires looking at the complete notebook)

4.  **Model Selection and Training:**
    * [cite_start] The notebook utilizes a `RandomForestRegressor` model from scikit-learn for predicting house prices[cite: 5].
    * [cite_start] The data was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance[cite: 5].

5.  **Model Evaluation:**
    * The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as:
        * [cite_start] `mean_squared_error` [cite: 5]
        * [cite_start] `mean_absolute_error` [cite: 5]
        * [cite_start] `r2_score` [cite: 5]

## Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome

* The notebook likely contains steps to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical features. Details on the specific techniques used would be found within the notebook's code.
* Feature engineering might have been employed to create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
* Choosing the right model and tuning its hyperparameters would have been a key part of the process.

## Instructions on How to Run the Code

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * matplotlib
    * seaborn
    * scikit-learn
    * scipy

    Install the required libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
    ```

2.  **Running the Notebook:**
    * Download the `DAVID_DAUDU_ML_PROJET (1).ipynb` file and the `bengaluru_house_prices.csv` dataset.
    * Place both files in the same directory.
    * Open the `DAVID_DAUDU_ML_PROJET (1).ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    * Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and reproduce the results.
